This is Virtual X, an old GTA Online menu mod that was discontinued in March, so I've updated it to be for story mode only. 

- To be able to play with it, you need to deactivate Batle Eye in the rockstar launcher settings.

- to inject the in-game menu, open the extreme injector provided in the download pack
and launch GTAV click on select next to process name click on windows list and click on select and then press inject. 

- The menu is controlled with these keys

- Open F5
- Scroll Up Arrow Up
- Scroll Down Arrow DOwn
- Value RIght Arrow Right
- Value Left Arrow Left
- Main Tab E
- Spawner Tab E

I would like to remind you that this Mod is only for the History Mod. If you try to go into GTA Online you risk getting banned but the menu has a protection the menu will deactivate.

- Script Hook V 

The menu is able to load any ASI you'll just need to download the ScriptHookV dll provided on one of my sites here : 

and place it at the root of the Virtual X folder in your documents.

Good Games
